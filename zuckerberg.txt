Hey everyone, we are live from my backyard, where I am smoking a brisket and some ribs. I am – I am making meats now, smoking these meats here or a little meat smoking. Its smoking. So I’m the meat chef.
Yeah, someone asked me do I smoke meat, smoking meat, smoking these meats, smoking meats earlier in the day, smoking these meats just set the charcoal up and you set the woodchips up and then smoking
meats grilling, grilling meats, good smoky flavor, smoke a brisket for like 12 hours.
You smoke lemon chicken, smoked salmon you’ll love it, bison sirloin, ribs and sausage, so I’m looking forward to that.
